# Framingham Risk Score
The Framingham Risk Score is a sex-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. 
The Framingham Risk Score was first developed based on data obtained from the Framingham Heart Study, to estimate the 10-year risk of 
developing coronary heart disease.
The first Framingham Risk Score included age, sex, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure (and also whether the patient is treated or not for his/her 
hypertension), diabetes, and smoking. It estimated the 10-year risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). It performed well and correctly predicted a 10-year risk for 
CHD in American men and women of European and African descent.

The updated version was modified to include dyslipidemia, age range, hypertension treatment, smoking, and total cholesterol, 
and it excluded diabetes, because Type 2 diabetes meanwhile was considered to be a CHD Risk Equivalent, having the same 10-year risk as individuals with prior CHD. 
Patients with Type 1 diabetes were considered separately with slightly less aggressive goals; while at increased risk, no study had shown them to be at equivalent 
risk for CHD as those with previously diagnosed coronary disease or Type 2 diabetes.

Framingham app will make complex calculations based on your entered data (age, sex, smoking status, treatment for hypertension, total cholesterol, 
HDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure) and will give you the result. <br/>
